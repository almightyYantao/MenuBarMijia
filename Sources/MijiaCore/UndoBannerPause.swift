/// Lets the panel hold the 撤销 banner open while the pointer rests on it.
///
/// Trade-off: resuming restarts the full banner duration instead of the exact remaining time. The
/// store's expiry task keeps no deadline, and a paused banner has no countdown UI, so re-arming the
/// whole window (10 s for one or two devices, 15 s from three) is the honest behaviour — the user
/// gets the full reading time after moving the pointer away (audit #53 allows "continue or reset").
